# CLAUDE.md — Niche Reviewer Template Playbook

> Auto-loaded by Claude Code. Playbook for populating this template with
> a new niche and deploying it. Written so a fresh session has everything
> it needs without reading the git history.

## Account & Deployment Context

**All repos in this directory belong to the `r2d2-pixel` GitHub account.**
Email: `r2d2@brandseoteam.com`. Do NOT push to `b1tterlemon` or any other account.

### Git authentication

The r2d2-pixel PAT is stored in `~/github/r2d2/.env.local` as `R2D2_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
Use it for any push by embedding it in the remote URL:

```bash
# One-time setup per new site repo:
git remote set-url origin https://r2d2-pixel:$R2D2_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/r2d2-pixel/REPO-NAME.git

# Or load the var first, then push normally:
source ~/github/r2d2/.env.local && git push origin main
```

For passwordless long-term use, configure SSH (key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_r2d2`):
```bash
# ~/.ssh/config entry:
# Host github-r2d2
#   HostName github.com
#   User git
#   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_r2d2
#
# Then set remote as: git@github-r2d2:r2d2-pixel/REPO-NAME.git
```

### Cloudflare account

Use the Cloudflare account tied to `r2d2@brandseoteam.com` — **not** the
`b1tterlemon` personal account. When deploying via the dashboard, make sure
you are logged in to the r2d2 Cloudflare account before creating Pages projects.

- Account ID: `1afb7a25a539f57955d72bba8f1cf374`
- API token: stored in `~/github/r2d2/.env.local` as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- MCP config: `.claude/settings.json` in each repo (gitignored) points all
  Cloudflare MCP servers at this account via Bearer token auth

### Local base directory

All r2d2 client sites live under: `~/github/r2d2/`
The template itself is at: `~/github/r2d2/niche-reviewer-template/`
New sites are cloned/created as siblings: `~/github/r2d2/SITE-NAME/`

### GitHub MCP note

The GitHub MCP in Claude Code sessions may be authenticated as `b1tterlemon`.
Do NOT use `mcp__github__create_repository` for r2d2 client sites — it will
create repos in the wrong account. Always use the curl API approach with
`R2D2_GITHUB_TOKEN`, or the `gh` CLI authenticated as `r2d2-pixel`.

## What This Template Is

A generic niche reviewer site built with Astro 5. Clone this repo, populate
`src/data/companies.ts` with verified company data, fill the TODO sections
in `src/pages/index.astro`, and deploy to Cloudflare Pages. All comparison,
alternatives, and profile pages generate automatically.

---

## Workflow Rules

**Always commit after every change.** After applying any edit to any file,
stage only the files in this repo and create a git commit immediately. Then
push to `origin main` so Cloudflare Pages deploys automatically.

```bash
git add src/...        # stage only changed files in this repo
git commit -m "..."
git push origin main
```

---

## Stack

## Phase 0 Setup Checklist (do this once per new site)

- [ ] `src/config.ts` — fill every TODO field (SITE, NICHE, BRANDING)
- [ ] `astro.config.mjs` — update `site:` to real domain
- [ ] `tailwind.config.mjs` — update `brand` color to match `BRANDING.primaryColor`
- [ ] `public/favicon.svg` — replace with a niche-appropriate icon using the brand color
- [ ] `src/data/companies.ts` — add at least 5 company objects
- [ ] `src/lib/companies.ts` — update `SERVICE_LABELS` to match your badge values
- [ ] `src/pages/index.astro` — fill all TODO sections with niche-specific content
- [ ] `src/pages/comparisons/[slug].astro` — update `hasCap()` keys and `allTech` array
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — update "Rating logic" and "Known verified facts" sections below
- [ ] `npm run build` — verify clean build

---

## Content & Comparison Rules

Apply to all data edits, new company additions, and prose revisions.

### Rating logic

Ratings are editorial scores for **niche-specific delivery suitability** — not
overall company quality.

- No company should top every dimension. Identify dimension winners:
  - **Specialist depth:** [update with your niche's top specialist]
  - **Enterprise scale/compliance:** [update with your niche's largest firm]
  - **Cost/accessibility:** [update with your niche's budget option]
- Ratings must have ≥ 0.8 spread across the list (e.g. 4.8 down to 3.9)
- The top specialist boutique holds rank #1 (4.7–4.9 range)
- Large generalists score 0.5–1.0 lower than boutiques on specialist dimensions

### Factual accuracy rules

- Verify founding year, HQ, employee count from a primary source before adding
- Unverifiable marketing claims must be tagged: `(per company website; independently unverifiable)`
- Acquisitions and ownership changes must appear in `description` and `cons`
- Confirm cloud/tech partnership tiers from official partner directories only

### Known verified facts (update for your companies)

> Replace this section with verified facts for the companies you add.
> Keep only facts you confirmed from a primary source (company website,
> Crunchbase, LinkedIn, official partner directory).

```
[Company Name]: founded [year], HQ [city], [N] employees, [cert/tier]
[Company Name]: founded [year], HQ [city], [N] employees, [cert/tier]
...
```

### Comparison page logic

The `hasCap()` function in `comparisons/[slug].astro` drives all capability
✓/✗ tables. It reads from `badges` and `engagementModels` only. Never add a ✓
claim that isn't backed by actual data. Update the `hasCap()` function keys and
the `allTech` array to match your niche's capabilities and tools.

---

## When Adding a New Company

- [ ] Verify founding year from a primary source
- [ ] Verify HQ from a primary source; note if legal HQ differs from delivery centre
- [ ] Verify employee count from LinkedIn or Crunchbase
- [ ] Check for acquisitions or ownership changes — disclose in `description` + `cons`
- [ ] Confirm cloud/tech partnership tiers from official partner directories
- [ ] Set `rating` using the dimension logic above
- [ ] Ensure no company tops all dimensions
- [ ] Confirm `badges` only contain services the company actually delivers
- [ ] Badges must match keys in `SERVICE_LABELS` in `src/lib/companies.ts`
- [ ] Run `npm run build` and verify page count increases correctly

## Known Gotchas (same across all sites cloned from this template)

1. **`brand` color must match in two places.** `tailwind.config.mjs` `brand.600`
   and `BRANDING.primaryColor` in `src/config.ts` must be the same hex value.

2. **All internal `href` values must end with `/`.** `trailingSlash: 'always'`
   in `astro.config.mjs` enforces this. Any link missing the trailing slash
   triggers a redirect warning in the build log.

3. **`SERVICE_LABELS` keys must match `badges` values exactly.** Every string
   in every company's `badges` array must have a matching key in `SERVICE_LABELS`
   in `src/lib/companies.ts`. Missing keys produce raw slugs on company cards.

4. **`StarRating` only accepts `rating: number`.** No other props.

5. **Comparison page slug format is `slug1-vs-slug2`.** `getComparisons()`
   returns this format. The dynamic route is `/comparisons/[slug].astro`.

6. **`hasCap()` keys in `comparisons/[slug].astro` must exactly match the
   capability labels in the JSX capability table.** If you rename one, rename both.

7. **`npm install` may fail with cache permission error.** Fix:
   `npm install --cache /tmp/npm-cache`. This bypasses the EACCES error on the
   default npm cache directory without requiring sudo.

8. **Cloudflare Pages uses `public/_headers` and `public/_redirects`**,
   not `vercel.json`. Do not add a `vercel.json` — it will be ignored.

9. **`astro.config.mjs` redirects go in `redirects:`.** Do not define the
   same path in both a `.astro` file and as a redirect.

10. **Cloudflare Pages project MUST be created from the dashboard, not the API.**
    Creating a project via the Cloudflare API (POST `/accounts/{id}/pages/projects`)
    produces a "Direct Upload" project. Direct Upload projects cannot have a GitHub
    repo connected — neither via the API (`PATCH` with `source:` returns error
    `8000069`) nor via the dashboard. If you hit "A project with this name already
    exists", the existing project is likely a Direct Upload project. Fix:
    1. Delete it via API: `DELETE /accounts/{id}/pages/projects/{name}`
    2. Recreate from the Cloudflare dashboard: **Pages → Create a project →
       Connect to Git** → select the GitHub repo → set build command `npm run build`,
       output dir `dist`.
    Always use "Connect to Git" from the start. Never create Pages projects via the
    API for git-backed deployments.

11. **`git init` creates `master` branch by default on macOS.** Rename it to `main`
    immediately: `git branch -m master main`. Do this before the first commit so
    all history is on `main` from the start. Cloudflare Pages and GitHub both
    expect `main`.

12. **`public/favicon.svg` must be replaced per site.** The template ships a placeholder favicon. Replace it with a niche-appropriate icon using the site's `BRANDING.primaryColor`. `Base.astro` already contains `<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg">` — no other changes needed in the layout.

13. **No table on the homepage may be all-dashes.** A table where every data cell
    shows "–" means a mismatch between the column keywords and the actual data.
    After populating `companies.ts`, run `npm run build` and visually check every
    matrix/capability table. The engagement models table auto-generates its columns
    from `engagementModels` values in the data — it is safe. Any other matrix table
    that checks for keywords must be verified: the keywords must be substrings of the
    actual data values. Fix by updating the keyword list to match your niche's
    terminology.

## Build Commands

```bash
npm install                    # first time / after adding dependencies
npm run dev                    # local dev server → http://localhost:4321
npm run build                  # production build → dist/
npm run preview                # preview dist/ locally
npm install --cache /tmp/npm-cache   # workaround if npm cache has permission errors
```

## Current Status

**Template — initial state.** No companies added. All niche-specific TODO
sections in `src/pages/index.astro` are placeholders awaiting real content.

Data layer: TypeScript (`src/data/companies.ts`). Companies: none — add yours.
